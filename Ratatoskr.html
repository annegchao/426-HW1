            <p id="description">Ratatoskr is a mythological creature resembling a squirrel that originates (approximately) from 13th century Norse Mythology. A direct translation of his name means "Rat Tusk", or "Tusk the Traveller". Ratatoskr serves as the messenger that runs up and down <a id="textlink" href="./Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil, the tree of life</a>, and carries "slanderous gossip" between the eagle god <a id="textlink" href="./Veorfolnir">Veðrfölnir</a> and <a id="textlink" href="./Nidhoggr">Nidhögg</a> the dragon. On a poetic account from the Norse God Odin:</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">"Ratatosk is the squirrel named, who has run</br>
                in Yggdrasil's ash;<br/>
                he from above the eagle's words must carry,<br/>
                and beneath the Nidhögg repeat."<br/></p>
            
            <p>Ratatoskr is regarded as a very minor god, given the low status of messengers within the ancient Norse culture. It has been theorized that it is because of this occupation status that Ratatoskr was described to be a squirrel, which would have been a common animal with fairly low status.<br/><br/>There is no more mention of Ratatoskr past the above information in Norse mythology.</p>

            <p>Despite his low status, the modern age has taken a much better liking to Ratatoskr. For one, more individuals would probably regard squirrels more as "cute" than as pests. Also, who wouldn't appreicate a minor god whose sole job is to carry hate mail between two even bigger gods? The squirrel has even been adapted into video games and stories that spin this create into a much more important god. The popular MMORPG Smite  redesigned him into <a id="textlink" href="https://smite.gamepedia.com/Ratatoskr">Ratatoskr, The Sly Messenger</a>, featured as a powerful assassin character who jumps and darts through the battlefield.</p>
