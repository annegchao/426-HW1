            <p id="description">    Gods. They rule almost every force of nature in mythology, no matter the language, the culture, or the people.
                Divine power courses through their veins as they string together the very fabric of time itself. The very definition of a god... does not fit this website's star at all.
                But since he's a fun character to talk about, we shall dedicate this first assignment to him.
                Ratatoskr is indeed a "god", but he has received nothing in terms of supernatural powers or status. In fact, there is literally only one singular mention of him in all of Norse Mythology.

                Despite his unfortunate circumstance, Ratatoskr does his job well, and such is a job that only Ratatoskr would be willing to do. His story and interactions with other gods and mythological figures
                is just barely enough content to fit the curriculum of this assignment, but isn't that all that's needed anyways?
